provide some useful tools

The most suprising and complex tool is THE UP_SCALER ,it shows a new way to solve the problem that a model can't recongnize a far object because the high difination picture input is much biger than what a model can inference(the model_size).This tool could cut-and-combine the photos to boost the far-object-recongnize-abillity.

if these tools are useful or enlightening，please light a star✨
